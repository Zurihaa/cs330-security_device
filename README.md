# What this Program Does #
This program is the function to unlock or lock the device based on the user input

## Notes ##
The benchmarking cell takes a long time to run, because it tries every possible input combination.
It does eventually terminate.

# How to Run #
This project was written in Jupyter Notebooks using Python 3, so it does not need to be built.
Install Python and Jupyter Notebooks, then run the notebook to test all the code.

## How to Run Tests ##
Some unit tests are defined within a cell further down in the notebook.
To run the unit tests, just evaluate the cell like you would any other.

# Environment #
OS: Windows 11
Python: 3.10.6
